# ChurnHackathon

This repository contains the machine learning solution I developed and submitted for the **Deloitte Experience Analytics Hackathon 2023**, where our team won **2nd place** out of 13 teams for the quality, performance, and interpretability of the model.

---

## Project Overview

The aim of this project was to build a predictive model to **identify customer churn in the telecom sector** using structured data. Key aspects included:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and evaluation
- Interpretability and business insights

---

## Tools and Techniques

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Feature importance analysis
- Model performance metrics (Accuracy, F1 Score, AUC)
- Train-test splitting and cross-validation

---

## My Contribution

This solution was:
- Fully implemented by **Lara Masad**, with all data preparation, modeling, and analysis carried out independently.
- Presented with code clarity and reproducibility in mind.

Although another person was listed in the submission, **this repository represents my individual work** and contributions.
